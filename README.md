# RCTV

## what is this

an IRL tv dashboard at the [Recurse Center](https://recurse.com/) with "tv apps" to bridge the physical-virtual schism

## how to dev (backend)

- you need a local postgres db

### first time:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

create a new postgres database for rctv

```bash
# macOS (adapt for your OS)
initdb -A trust /usr/local/var/postgres
# Connect to default DB
psql -U $USER -d -d postgres
```

```sql
# Create a new postgres user for RCTV
# SQL
CREATE USER rctv;
CREATE DATABASE rctv WITH OWNER="rctv";
quit;

# Connection string will be postgres://rctv@localhost:5432/rctv
```

define an `.env` file. Copy from `.env.example` and fill in the values inside `""` quotes:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

[create a Zulip
Bot](https://zulip.com/api/deploying-bots#running-a-bot-using-the-zulip-botserver)
(choose Outgoing Webhook Bot), [download its `zuliprc` file](https://zulip.com/api/api-keys), 
and move it to the root of this repository + rename it to `.zuliprc` (with a dot at the beginning)

```bash
cp ~/Downloads/zuliprc .zuliprc
```

also! create a django super user for yourself!

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
# answer admin (username), a@a.ca, admin (password) and 'y' to confirm the bad password
```

### every time:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver
```

## how to dev (sdk / frontend app javascript) - short version

1. make sure that bun is installed, see sdk/README.md for more details

from repo dir:
```bash
cd sdk
bun watch
```

2. you will also need to run the vite bundler in parallel for app.html frontend scripts

first time:
```bash
cd core/static_src
npm install
```

then every time - from repo dir:
```bash
cd core/static_src
npm run dev
```

3. we're not done...

- you'll want to run `ngrok` and go [through these steps](./docs/HOWTODEV-OAUTH.md) so that rctv-dev.recurse.com works & points to your local django localhost:8000
- we might have even more terminals/servers to run simultaneously (when we introduce websockets??), stay tuned.........

## raspi things

- the most up to date (as of August 2025) app that runs on the pi [is here](https://github.com/gregsadetsky/rctv-tauri)!!! rust baby!!!
- previous [raspberry pi files repo is here](https://github.com/gregsadetsky/rctv-raspi).
